# E-commerce(challenge-13)

# Description

This files are created to complete the Module 13 challenge-13

I want to have an app to track the products, categories and their tags as they are being stocked

This is so that users can save time by seeing lists and trackspecific products.

I learned that ManytoMany is a very good sorting method for track ids in different tables.
